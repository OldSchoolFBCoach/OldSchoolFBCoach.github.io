<li>Computer controlled players are now smart enough to take a touchback when appropriate after receiving a kick, interception, or fumble. They now no longer always try to run the ball out of their endzone.</li>
<li>Players now celebrate after scoring.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="improvements--tweaks--bug-fixes">Improvements / Tweaks / Bug Fixes</h4>

            <div><p>A new update (21-10) of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is here! The new changes include the following:</p>
<h4 id="new-features">New Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Teams now have head coaches associated with them that modify different aspects of the team.
<ul>
<li>Coaches now have their own playbook, meaning teams no longer have the same plays available to them. You can likewise set up your own playbook in career mode.</li>
<li>Coaches can set a desired offensive philosophy, such as &ldquo;power run&rdquo;, &ldquo;quick pass&rdquo;, and more. Offensive philosophy Impacts the AI coach play calling.</li>
<li>Coaches can set a desired balance between run and pass plays. This impacts the AI coach play calling.</li>
<li>Coaches can set their base formations. This impacts recruiting focus and AI coach playbooks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is now support for QB run option plays. Not only are option plays available to call during the game, but you can also now design your own QB run option style plays as well.

<figure>
	<img src="/blog/build-2110-optionplays/OptionPlay.gif" alt="Players can now get injured during game play" />
</figure></li>
<li>AI coaches will now adjust play calling based on player abilities. For example, they will pay attention to how strong of a leg their kicker has before attempting a long field goal.</li>
<li>More built-in plays have been added to the game.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="improvements--tweaks--bug-fixes">Improvements / Tweaks / Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Defenders now have more of a random reaction delay when figuring out when the ball is run or thrown. This change slightly buffs offensive production.</li>
<li>When the ball is thrown to a receiver, other receivers will now attempt to block for them.</li>
<li>A player&rsquo;s height is now properly used when determining collisions with the football. Previously the game assumed all players were 6ft tall.</li>
<li>In the play designer it&rsquo;s possible to tell a receiver to stop once their route is completed, but they previously wouldn&rsquo;t actually stop. This has now been implemented properly.</li>
<li>The play designer no longer allows you to give players bogus behaviors. These bogus behaviors were stand-in ideas for future additions to the game, but hadn&rsquo;t been implemented. Thus players wouldn&rsquo;t behave correctly if you gave them one of these behaviors.</li>
<li>Players no longer get fatigued when simulating plays in the play designer.</li>
<li>The stadium around the field has received some updated graphics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy coaching!</p>

            <h3>Build 2108 Available - Create a Player &amp; More</h3>
            <div><div class="BlogPostCategory">Announcement</div></div>
            <div class="subtitle">August 07, 2021 <a href="https://OldSchoolFBCoach.github.io/blog/build-2108-createaplayer/">(Link)</a></div>
            <div><p>A new update (21-08) of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is here! The new updates include the following:</p>
<h4 id="new-features">New Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to create and edit players. This can be accessed by editing a team through the league management menu and clicking a button to edit the team&rsquo;s roster. From there you can select new options to add/edit/delete players.</li>
<li>It is now possible to set a team&rsquo;s desired text font, similar to setting team colors. The football field will now display the home team&rsquo;s mascot name in the end zones using the desired font.</li>
<li>Player names are now shown during the game action</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="improvements">Improvements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Players in the defense secondary are now smarter. If a play utilizes multiple safeties, they will try to do a better job covering different sides of the field and not bunch up. Secondary players will also now do a better job recognizing when they need to contest a catch. The latter improvement is actually more of a bug fix. When the ball was thrown by the offense, there was an error that made defenders ignore offensive players and thus always assume they could make an easy interception without worrying about an offensive player jumping in front of them to make the catch instead. This has been fixed so that defenders do a better job of recognizing when they should try to jump and &ldquo;high point&rdquo; a catch.</li>
<li>A consequence of making defensive players smarter, as described in the previous change, is that interceptions would occur a lot more often. To combat this, defender catching abilities have been reduced to bring the rate of interceptions back down.</li>
<li>Punters now try to kick balls at a slightly higher angle so that they don&rsquo;t out-kick their coverage team as often.</li>
<li>Depth chart generation has been improved so that players aren&rsquo;t placed out of their main position so much.</li>
<li>Added initial support for backwards compatible career and league saves. Up until this point, trying to use old save files with new builds of the game could lead to silent corruptions and crashes. Starting with save files generated by this build and going forward, save files will either be upgraded to be compatible with the new build, or you will be explicitly notified about the incompatibility.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that would prevent independent teams from generating a proper schedule in career mode. This bug would cause independent teams to only have 1 or 2 games on their schedule instead of the desired 12.</li>
<li>Fixed a few rare bugs that could lead to the game crashing</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy coaching!</p>

<h4 id="player-injuries">Player Injuries</h4>
<p>Football players can now get injured during games. The chances of injury increase as the player&rsquo;s fatigue worsens. An injury to a player in career mode might mean several weeks of healing, resulting in players missing games. Be sure to bench your best players when you find yourself in the middle of a blow-out to prevent costly injuries!</p>

            <div><p>Happy Memorial Day! A new development build (21-06) of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is now publicly available, which, in addition to various bug fixes, includes 2 major features!</p>
<h4 id="player-fatigue">Player Fatigue</h4>
<p>The football players on your team have always had a stamina attribute, but until now it didn&rsquo;t have a major impact on their performance. That all changes with this update. Players will now get fatigued as they play, and as their condition worsens so will their other abilities. You can combat this by temporarily benching your tired players and give them time to rest and recover.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/blog/build-2106/stamina.png" alt="Players now get fatigued during their games" />
</figure>
<h4 id="ui-scaling">UI Scaling</h4>
<p>Previously, playing the game on a small screen or high resolution display could make the UI elements small and hard to read. This build adds a UI scale adjustment to the Game Options. It is now possible to make the UI elements 1.5x or 2x bigger!  This may seem like a small change, but behind the scenes a lot of code needed to be written to make this possible. Though, do note that the game doesn&rsquo;t play well (and will warn you) when the UI is scaled with the window set at a low resolution. This effectively reduces the amount of space that UI elements have to fit inside of, which some screens and menus in the game can&rsquo;t yet accommodate.</p>

            <div><p>Development build (21-05) of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is now publicly available! Notable changes include:</p>
<h4 id="new-features--improvements">New Features / Improvements</h4>
<ul>
<li>In career mode, recruits can now have a new interest: &ldquo;Recent Success&rdquo;. In other words, if recent success is important to a recruit, you can influence them more towards your team if you&rsquo;ve been doing well lately. This interest is also different from the other ones because the recruit&rsquo;s feelings can change on it week-to-week depending on how your team is doing. Your positive influence might turn into a negative influence if you start losing a lot of games!</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s now possible to separately select offense, defense, and special teams skill when generating new team rosters. This gives a little more variety because it&rsquo;s now possible to end up with teams that have, for example, a really good offense but bad defense.</li>
<li>Additional variety has been added to player images.</li>
<li>A little polish was added to the team selection screen before a game. It now shows a preview of what each team&rsquo;s uniform looks like.</li>
<li>AI coaches no longer call user-created plays. This prevents the ability to make broken plays that the opposing team might try to run occasionally and always fail.</li>
<li>It is no longer possible to delete built-in plays. This helps prevent getting into a state where all plays have been deleted and need to be recreated.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when players were manually added to a team&rsquo;s depth chart, they might always be assigned as a QB instead of the desired position.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the game would become temporarily unresponsive if new teams were being mass generated. The &ldquo;Generate Random Teams&rdquo; dialog will now show progress as new teams are being made.</li>
<li>Fixed an crash that could happen while editing the roster of an existing team in the League Management menu.</li>
<li>Fixed an hang that could happen when a custom league had fewer teams than what was needed to fill the playoffs in career mode.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when generating a league with 20+ conferences.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when creating a new team and assigning a non-number to the school&rsquo;s enrollment field.</li>
<li>Fixed a scheduling bug in career mode that could result in too few conference games being scheduled for a team</li>

            <div><p>A new early access development build (2021-04) of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is now publicly available! Notable changes include:</p>
<h4 id="postseason-games">Postseason Games</h4>
<p>There is now support for postseason games and they are highly customizable! You can configure the number of playoff spots available in your league and decide of if only the top-ranked teams make it in, or if conference champions have an automatic bid. You can also decide if you want to create your own bowl games and how teams get selected for them as well.</p>
<h4 id="other-improvements-and-fixes">Other Improvements and Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Performance optimizations have been put in place when calculating team rankings between weeks. This reduces the time spent waiting for a week to complete and the next week to start. The performance of these calculations scale with the number of teams in the league, so it is now more feasible to have leagues with a larger number of teams in them.</li>
<li>Some minor visual enhancements have been added to the field and player animations. For example, there is now an animation for when a tackled player stands back up.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>

<h4 id="other-improvemetns">Other Improvemetns</h4>
<ul>
<li>Major performance optimizations have been put in place when generating new teams and starting new careers. Specifically the game is now up to 7 times faster at generating players, depth charts, recruits, and putting together league schedules. The performance of these activities scales with the number of teams in the league, so it is now more feasible to have leagues with a larger number of teams in them.</li>
<li>School generation is no longer prone to making a bunch of schools in the same state. It now spreads schools throughout the 50 states a little better.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to control players during kickoffs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in career mode where sometimes game results weren&rsquo;t recorded properly after the first season was played.</li>
<li>Players no longer keep their stats during a play that had a penalty accepted.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where accepting a penalty could move the ball to the other side of the field.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare crash that could happen in career mode while simulating league games between weeks.</li>
<li>When playing an exhibition game, switching leagues no longer breaks the ability to control players.</li>

            <h3>Old School Football Coach Dev Build 2021-01 Now Available</h3>
            <div><div class="BlogPostCategory">Announcement</div></div>
            <div class="subtitle">January 23, 2021 <a href="https://OldSchoolFBCoach.github.io/blog/oldschoolfbcoach-dev-build-202101-now-available/">(Link)</a></div>
            <div><p>A new development build of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is now publicly available! This update largely focuses on new features and improvements, listed below.</p>
<h4 id="remappable-keybindings">Remappable Keybindings</h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s now possible to configure in-game controls from the Settings menu. Right now this only supports keyboard keys, but controller support is a planned feature for the future.</p>
<h4 id="control-the-snap">Control the Snap</h4>
<p>While on offense and using the standard control method, it is now possible to control when the ball gets snapped. Previously your team would automatically snap the ball about 3 seconds after the players were set, but It&rsquo;s now possible to snap the ball earlier if you&rsquo;re in a hurry or much later if need to run down the clock. By default this action is mapped to the &lsquo;F&rsquo; key, but is also configurable in the Settings menu.</p>
<h4 id="play-clock">Play Clock</h4>
<p><strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> now has a play clock. This was a big gap in previous builds, making it possible for players to stay in the play selection screen for as long as they wanted in order to drain the game clock. The play clock now ensures the game keeps moving along.</p>
<h4 id="introduction-of-penalties">Introduction of Penalties</h4>
<p>A play clock doesn&rsquo;t do much good unless there are consequences when time runs out. Therefore, a framework for penalties was put into place this build, with Delay of Game being one of two penalties supported so far. The other penalty in place is Defenseive Offsides. Without these two penalties it&rsquo;s pretty easy for the player to come up with game-breaking strategies, and thus the implementation of these two penalties was prioritized first. I expect more types of penalties to come in a future build. One gap that still exists in the penalty framework is the ability to decline them. Support for declining penalties is also a planned feature for a future build.</p>
<h4 id="other-improvements">Other Improvements</h4>
<ul>
<li>The current ball yardline is now shown on the scoreboard.</li>
<li>The announcer will now announce when there a turnover on downs or flag on the play.</li>
<li>It is now possible to access the game menu while on the play selection screen.</li>
</ul>
