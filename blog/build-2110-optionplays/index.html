      <div><p>A new update (21-10) of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is here! The new changes include the following:</p>
<h4 id="new-features">New Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Teams now have head coaches associated with them that modify different aspects of the team.
<ul>
<li>Coaches now have their own playbook, meaning teams no longer have the same plays available to them. You can likewise set up your own playbook in career mode.</li>
<li>Coaches can set a desired offensive philosophy, such as &ldquo;power run&rdquo;, &ldquo;quick pass&rdquo;, and more. Offensive philosophy Impacts the AI coach play calling.</li>
<li>Coaches can set a desired balance between run and pass plays. This impacts the AI coach play calling.</li>
<li>Coaches can set their base formations. This impacts recruiting focus and AI coach playbooks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is now support for QB run option plays. Not only are option plays available to call during the game, but you can also now design your own QB run option style plays as well.

   </figure></li>
<li>AI coaches will now adjust play calling based on player abilities. For example, they will pay attention to how strong of a leg their kicker has before attempting a long field goal.</li>
<li>More built-in plays have been added to the game.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="improvements--tweaks--bug-fixes">Improvements / Tweaks / Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Defenders now have more of a random reaction delay when figuring out when the ball is run or thrown. This change slightly buffs offensive production.</li>
<li>When the ball is thrown to a receiver, other receivers will now attempt to block for them.</li>
<li>A player&rsquo;s height is now properly used when determining collisions with the football. Previously the game assumed all players were 6ft tall.</li>
<li>In the play designer it&rsquo;s possible to tell a receiver to stop once their route is completed, but they previously wouldn&rsquo;t actually stop. This has now been implemented properly.</li>
<li>The play designer no longer allows you to give players bogus behaviors. These bogus behaviors were stand-in ideas for future additions to the game, but hadn&rsquo;t been implemented. Thus players wouldn&rsquo;t behave correctly if you gave them one of these behaviors.</li>
<li>Players no longer get fatigued when simulating plays in the play designer.</li>
<li>The stadium around the field has received some updated graphics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy coaching!</p>
