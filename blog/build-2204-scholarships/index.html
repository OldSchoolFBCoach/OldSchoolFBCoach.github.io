      <h3>Build 22-04 - Scholarships &amp; More</h3>

      <div class="subtitle">April 20, 2022 <a href="https://OldSchoolFBCoach.github.io/blog/build-2204-scholarships/">(Link)</a></div>
      <div><p>A new update (22-04) of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is here! The new changes include the following:</p>
<h4 id="new-major-features">New Major Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>In career mode, if you want a recruit to join your school you now have to offer them a scholarship. Recruits will no longer automatically join the school with the most recruiting points at the end of the season. Instead, they will join the school with the most recruiting points that has also offered them a scholarship. Additionally recruits can also now commit to a school in any given week, not just at the end of the season. This adds another layer of strategy because you only have 25 scholarship offers to give out each season, and revoking a recruit&rsquo;s offer has consequences!</li>
<li>There is now a menu page to see recruit class rankings. The rankings get updated as recruits begin committing to schools. You can use this page to see how your recruiting class is stacking up against the competition.</li>
<li>Three additional defensive stats are now tracked during games: Number of tackles, sacks, and passes defended.</li>
<li>There is now support for pitch plays. Meaning, when the play calls for it, the QB is now able to pitch the ball to the running back during running plays. New built-in plays have been added to the game that utilize this feature. Additionally it&rsquo;s now also possible to create your own pitch play in the Play Designer.</li>
<li>It is now possible for defensive players to attempt blocking Field Goal and Punt kicks. Proper kick defense built-in plays have been implemented, and it&rsquo;s possible for you to implement your own in the Play Designer as well.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="other-general-improvements-and-bug-fixes">Other general improvements and bug fixes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Quick Sim games have been tuned to reduce the number of interceptions.</li>
<li>Quarterbacks were previously going through their WR progression in the wrong order during quick sim games. This often resulted in the HB being the primary target on passing plays. This has been corrected.</li>
<li>Some built-in plays have been given better names.</li>
<li>AI coaches are now smarter about calling FG plays when time is running out, even if it isn&rsquo;t 4th down.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause the wrong team to kickoff if there was a turnover during an &ldquo;extra point&rdquo;  attempt.</li>
<li>Some visuals have been slightly improved.</li>
<li>Other minor bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy Coaching!</p>
