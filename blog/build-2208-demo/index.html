      <div class="subtitle">August 07, 2022 <a href="https://OldSchoolFBCoach.github.io/blog/build-2208-demo/">(Link)</a></div>
      <div><p>A new update (22-08) of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is here! The new changes include the following:</p>
<h4 id="free-demo">Free Demo!</h4>
<p>Old School Football Coach now has a free demo available for download. The demo limits career mode to just 2 weeks of play, but is otherwise fully featured! You can now try the game out before you buy.</p>
<h4 id="new-features">New Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Each team now has 3 coaches, a head coach and two assistant coaches.</li>
<li>Head coaches and assistant coaches can now have abilities to help (or sometimes hurt) their team! These abilities, for example, might increase the rate of player development, help reduce the number of injuries, or help pull in new recruits.</li>
<li>Fumbles are now part of the game. Players have a new attribute, &ldquo;Ball Security&rdquo;, which determines how good they are at holding on to the ball. Low ball security can translate into an increased number of fumbles.</li>
<li>The game now keeps track of more player stats such as QB rating, pass completion percentage, dropped passes, average rushing yards, fumbles, FG percentage, and broken tackles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: This build of the game is not backwards compatible with saves from previous versions.</p>
<p>Happy Coaching!</p>
