      <h3>Build 22-11 - Import/Export Teams &amp; More!</h3>
      <div><div class="BlogPostCategory">Announcement</div></div>
      <div class="subtitle">October 31, 2022 <a href="https://OldSchoolFBCoach.github.io/blog/build-2211-importexport/">(Link)</a></div>
      <div><p>A new update (22-11) of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is here! The new changes include the following:</p>
<h4 id="import--export-teams">Import / Export Teams</h4>
<p>This long requested feature is finally here! It is now possible to easily export your custom teams from the League Management screen! Likewise, you can now also easily import teams that have been created by others! Now you can share your favorite custom teams with friends and build up a league together. Note: implementing this feature required substantial changes to the inner workings of the game, which has broken backwards compatibility. You will not be able to carry forward leagues, teams, or career saves from a previous version of the game.</p>
<h4 id="stamina-management-improvements">Stamina Management Improvements</h4>
<p>When playing a football game, players now have an animation that shows when they are starting to get tired. Additionally, keyboard hotkeys have been added to the play call screen to help you quickly manage your players. By default you can press [Tab] to quickly switch to the Substitutions screen, arrow keys to navigate through your players, and [Enter] to bench or activate a player.</p>
<p>Happy Coaching!</p>
