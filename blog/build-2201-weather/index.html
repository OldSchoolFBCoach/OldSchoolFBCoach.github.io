      <div><p>A new update (22-01) of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is here! The new changes include the following:</p>
<h4 id="new-major-features">New Major Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rain and snow weather effects have been added. These effects can be turned on or off when setting up an exhibition game, but in career mode the weather is random. Rain and snow slightly impact QB throwing accuracy and other player skills.</li>
<li>In career mode there are now two new topics you can talk to recruits about when trying to sway them towards your school. These topics are conference prestige and conference strength. This makes recruiting slightly easier for teams in a better conference.</li>
<li>It is now possible to get an overview of the general strength of each team, broken down by offense, defense, and special teams.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="improvements--tweaks--bug-fixes">Improvements / Tweaks / Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Career Mode early season team rankings have been improved. Rankings were previously completely based on team performance. However, this would cause early season rankings to be very inaccurate due to there not being many game results yet to judge teams by. Preseason rankings  in particular might as well have been completely random. Now early season rankings have a bias towards how well a team is expected to perform that season.</li>
<li>In career mode you are now warned when you try to end a week without using up all of your recruiting points.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that made FG kickers 100% accurate when the game was run through a quick simulation.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented a 2 point safety from being registered properly if it was 4th down.</li>
<li>Various other miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy coaching!</p>
