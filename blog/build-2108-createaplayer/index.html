      <h3>Build 2108 Available - Create a Player &amp; More</h3>

      <div><p>A new update (21-08) of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is here! The new updates include the following:</p>
<h4 id="new-features">New Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to create and edit players. This can be accessed by editing a team through the league management menu and clicking a button to edit the team&rsquo;s roster. From there you can select new options to add/edit/delete players.</li>
<li>It is now possible to set a team&rsquo;s desired text font, similar to setting team colors. The football field will now display the home team&rsquo;s mascot name in the end zones using the desired font.</li>
<li>Player names are now shown during the game action</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="improvements">Improvements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Players in the defense secondary are now smarter. If a play utilizes multiple safeties, they will try to do a better job covering different sides of the field and not bunch up. Secondary players will also now do a better job recognizing when they need to contest a catch. The latter improvement is actually more of a bug fix. When the ball was thrown by the offense, there was an error that made defenders ignore offensive players and thus always assume they could make an easy interception without worrying about an offensive player jumping in front of them to make the catch instead. This has been fixed so that defenders do a better job of recognizing when they should try to jump and &ldquo;high point&rdquo; a catch.</li>
<li>A consequence of making defensive players smarter, as described in the previous change, is that interceptions would occur a lot more often. To combat this, defender catching abilities have been reduced to bring the rate of interceptions back down.</li>
<li>Punters now try to kick balls at a slightly higher angle so that they don&rsquo;t out-kick their coverage team as often.</li>
<li>Depth chart generation has been improved so that players aren&rsquo;t placed out of their main position so much.</li>
<li>Added initial support for backwards compatible career and league saves. Up until this point, trying to use old save files with new builds of the game could lead to silent corruptions and crashes. Starting with save files generated by this build and going forward, save files will either be upgraded to be compatible with the new build, or you will be explicitly notified about the incompatibility.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that would prevent independent teams from generating a proper schedule in career mode. This bug would cause independent teams to only have 1 or 2 games on their schedule instead of the desired 12.</li>
<li>Fixed a few rare bugs that could lead to the game crashing</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy coaching!</p>
