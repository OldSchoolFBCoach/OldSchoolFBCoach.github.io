      <div><p>Development build (21-05) of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is now publicly available! Notable changes include:</p>
<h4 id="new-features--improvements">New Features / Improvements</h4>
<ul>
<li>In career mode, recruits can now have a new interest: &ldquo;Recent Success&rdquo;. In other words, if recent success is important to a recruit, you can influence them more towards your team if you&rsquo;ve been doing well lately. This interest is also different from the other ones because the recruit&rsquo;s feelings can change on it week-to-week depending on how your team is doing. Your positive influence might turn into a negative influence if you start losing a lot of games!</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s now possible to separately select offense, defense, and special teams skill when generating new team rosters. This gives a little more variety because it&rsquo;s now possible to end up with teams that have, for example, a really good offense but bad defense.</li>
<li>Additional variety has been added to player images.</li>
<li>A little polish was added to the team selection screen before a game. It now shows a preview of what each team&rsquo;s uniform looks like.</li>
<li>AI coaches no longer call user-created plays. This prevents the ability to make broken plays that the opposing team might try to run occasionally and always fail.</li>
<li>It is no longer possible to delete built-in plays. This helps prevent getting into a state where all plays have been deleted and need to be recreated.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when players were manually added to a team&rsquo;s depth chart, they might always be assigned as a QB instead of the desired position.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the game would become temporarily unresponsive if new teams were being mass generated. The &ldquo;Generate Random Teams&rdquo; dialog will now show progress as new teams are being made.</li>
<li>Fixed an crash that could happen while editing the roster of an existing team in the League Management menu.</li>
<li>Fixed an hang that could happen when a custom league had fewer teams than what was needed to fill the playoffs in career mode.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when generating a league with 20+ conferences.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when creating a new team and assigning a non-number to the school&rsquo;s enrollment field.</li>
<li>Fixed a scheduling bug in career mode that could result in too few conference games being scheduled for a team</li>
</ul>
