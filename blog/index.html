            <h3>Oldschoolfbcoach Dev Build 202102 Now Available</h3>
            <div><div class="BlogPostCategory">Announcement</div></div>
            <div class="subtitle">March 05, 2021 <a href="https://OldSchoolFBCoach.github.io/blog/oldschoolfbcoach-dev-build-202102-now-available/">(Link)</a></div>
            <div><p>Another new development build of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is publicly available! Notable changes include:</p>
<h4 id="new-features">New Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Conference championship games have been implemented in career mode. At the end of the regular season the top two teams in each conference will be matched up for a conference championship game.</li>
<li>It is now possible to edit conferences in the League Management menu in addition to creating and deleting them.</li>
<li>Penalties can now be declined.</li>
<li>In career mode, the home page got a little bit of a facelift and now also shows conference standings.</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<h4 id="other-improvemetns">Other Improvemetns</h4>
<ul>
<li>Major performance optimizations have been put in place when generating new teams and starting new careers. Specifically the game is now up to 7 times faster at generating players, depth charts, recruits, and putting together league schedules. The performance of these activities scales with the number of teams in the league, so it is now more feasible to have leagues with a larger number of teams in them.</li>
<li>School generation is no longer prone to making a bunch of schools in the same state. It now spreads schools throughout the 50 states a little better.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to control players during kickoffs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in career mode where sometimes game results weren&rsquo;t recorded properly after the first season was played.</li>
<li>Players no longer keep their stats during a play that had a penalty accepted.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where accepting a penalty could move the ball to the other side of the field.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare crash that could happen in career mode while simulating league games between weeks.</li>
<li>When playing an exhibition game, switching leagues no longer breaks the ability to control players.</li>
</ul>

            <h3>Old School Football Coach Dev Build 2021-01 Now Available</h3>
            <div><div class="BlogPostCategory">Announcement</div></div>
            <div class="subtitle">January 23, 2021 <a href="https://OldSchoolFBCoach.github.io/blog/oldschoolfbcoach-dev-build-202101-now-available/">(Link)</a></div>
            <div><p>A new development build of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is now publicly available! This update largely focuses on new features and improvements, listed below.</p>
<h4 id="remappable-keybindings">Remappable Keybindings</h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s now possible to configure in-game controls from the Settings menu. Right now this only supports keyboard keys, but controller support is a planned feature for the future.</p>
<h4 id="control-the-snap">Control the Snap</h4>
<p>While on offense and using the standard control method, it is now possible to control when the ball gets snapped. Previously your team would automatically snap the ball about 3 seconds after the players were set, but It&rsquo;s now possible to snap the ball earlier if you&rsquo;re in a hurry or much later if need to run down the clock. By default this action is mapped to the &lsquo;F&rsquo; key, but is also configurable in the Settings menu.</p>
<h4 id="play-clock">Play Clock</h4>
<p><strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> now has a play clock. This was a big gap in previous builds, making it possible for players to stay in the play selection screen for as long as they wanted in order to drain the game clock. The play clock now ensures the game keeps moving along.</p>
<h4 id="introduction-of-penalties">Introduction of Penalties</h4>
<p>A play clock doesn&rsquo;t do much good unless there are consequences when time runs out. Therefore, a framework for penalties was put into place this build, with Delay of Game being one of two penalties supported so far. The other penalty in place is Defenseive Offsides. Without these two penalties it&rsquo;s pretty easy for the player to come up with game-breaking strategies, and thus the implementation of these two penalties was prioritized first. I expect more types of penalties to come in a future build. One gap that still exists in the penalty framework is the ability to decline them. Support for declining penalties is also a planned feature for a future build.</p>
<h4 id="other-improvements">Other Improvements</h4>
<ul>
<li>The current ball yardline is now shown on the scoreboard.</li>
<li>The announcer will now announce when there a turnover on downs or flag on the play.</li>
<li>It is now possible to access the game menu while on the play selection screen.</li>
</ul>

            <h3>Website Launch</h3>
            <div><div class="BlogPostCategory">Announcement</div></div>
            <div class="subtitle">August 01, 2020 <a href="https://OldSchoolFBCoach.github.io/blog/website-launch/">(Link)</a></div>
            <div><p>This is the new website for <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong>! <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong>
is an in-development American college football PC game in the sports management simulation
genre. You can call your team&rsquo;s plays and do your best to lead them to victory. For
a more in-depth experience, the game also offers a career mode where you can recruit new
players, set up depth charts, and other activities you would expect from a college football
coach.</p>
<p>I intend to add additional content to this site over time, such as pictures,
videos, and additional blog posts as development continue. Stay tuned!</p>
