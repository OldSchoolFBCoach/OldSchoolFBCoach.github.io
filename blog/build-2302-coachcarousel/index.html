      <div><p>A new update (23-02) of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is here! The new changes include the following:</p>
<h4 id="coaching-carousel-in-career-mode">Coaching Carousel in Career Mode</h4>
<ul>
<li>After the season ends you can now get offered coaching jobs at other schools depending on how your team has been performing.</li>
<li>AI schools can now fire under-performing coaches between seasons and attempt to hire better replacements from less prestigious schools or from the pool of unemployed coaches.</li>
<li>There is now an off-season period between seasons where you can fire your assistant coaches and hire new ones</li>
<li>Assistant coaches can now develop and gain new abilities between seasons</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="other-improvements">Other Improvements</h4>
<ul>
<li>New career mode saves will begin in the year 2023.</li>
<li>Several balance changes have been made to recruiting to help prevent the skill level of all teams from averaging out over time
<ul>
<li>Talented recruits are now more likely to care about high prestige and recent success in schools.</li>
<li>All recruits are now more likely to care about a school&rsquo;s proximity to their home.</li>
<li>Recruits are now more likely to commit slightly earlier if a good team has given them the best offer.</li>
<li>On average there will be less good recruits each season and more recruits on the lower end of the skill rankings</li>
<li>The number of available recruiting points has been halved so that a recruit&rsquo;s interests have a bigger impact</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additional types of media headlines can pop up during the career mode season to, for example, report on coaches that are on the hot seat or to report on post-season results.</li>
<li>Improvements have been made to the preseason ranking algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy Coaching!</p>
