      <div><p>A new early access development build (2021-04) of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is now publicly available! Notable changes include:</p>
<h4 id="postseason-games">Postseason Games</h4>
<p>There is now support for postseason games and they are highly customizable! You can configure the number of playoff spots available in your league and decide of if only the top-ranked teams make it in, or if conference champions have an automatic bid. You can also decide if you want to create your own bowl games and how teams get selected for them as well.</p>
<h4 id="other-improvements-and-fixes">Other Improvements and Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Performance optimizations have been put in place when calculating team rankings between weeks. This reduces the time spent waiting for a week to complete and the next week to start. The performance of these calculations scale with the number of teams in the league, so it is now more feasible to have leagues with a larger number of teams in them.
-Some minor visual enhancements have been added to the field and player animations. For example, there is now an animation for when a tackled player stands back up.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
