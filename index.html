               <div><div class="BlogPostCategory">Announcement</div></div>
               <div class="subtitle">March 05, 2021 <a href="https://OldSchoolFBCoach.github.io/blog/oldschoolfbcoach-dev-build-202102-now-available/">(Link)</a></div>
               <div><p>Another new development build of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is publicly available! Notable changes include:</p>
<h4 id="new-features">New Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Conference championship games have been implemented in career mode. At the end of the regular season the top two teams in each conference will be matched up for a conference championship game.</li>
<li>It is now possible to edit conferences in the League Management menu in addition to creating and deleting them.</li>
<li>Penalties can now be declined.</li>
<li>In career mode, the home page got a little bit of a facelift and now also shows conference standings.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="other-improvemetns">Other Improvemetns</h4>
<ul>
<li>Major performance optimizations have been put in place when generating new teams and starting new careers. Specifically the game is now up to 7 times faster at generating players, depth charts, recruits, and putting together league schedules. The performance of these activities scales with the number of teams in the league, so it is now more feasible to have leagues with a larger number of teams in them.</li>
<li>School generation is no longer prone to making a bunch of schools in the same state. It now spreads schools throughout the 50 states a little better.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to control players during kickoffs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in career mode where sometimes game results weren&rsquo;t recorded properly after the first season was played.</li>
<li>Players no longer keep their stats during a play that had a penalty accepted.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where accepting a penalty could move the ball to the other side of the field.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare crash that could happen in career mode while simulating league games between weeks.</li>
<li>When playing an exhibition game, switching leagues no longer breaks the ability to control players.</li>
</ul>
