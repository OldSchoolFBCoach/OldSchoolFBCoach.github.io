               <div><div class="BlogPostCategory">Announcement</div></div>
               <div class="subtitle">December 01, 2021 <a href="https://OldSchoolFBCoach.github.io/blog/build-2112-timeouts/">(Link)</a></div>
               <div><p>A new update (21-12) of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is here! The new changes include the following:</p>
<h4 id="new-features">New Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Timeouts have been implemented! It&rsquo;s now possible to call a timeout during the game. Calling a timeout allows you to stop the game clock, reset the play clock, and select a new play before the ball is snapped. Timeouts can be called from the game menu.</li>
<li>Computer controlled players are now smart enough to take a touchback when appropriate after receiving a kick, interception, or fumble. They now no longer always try to run the ball out of their endzone.</li>
<li>Players now celebrate after scoring.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="improvements--tweaks--bug-fixes">Improvements / Tweaks / Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>The ESC key will now launch the in-game menu while playing a football game</li>
<li>The simulation dialog is now more responsive while running a deep simulation.</li>
<li>The game clock now correctly stops when there is a change in possession</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy coaching!</p>
