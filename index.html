               <div class="subtitle">August 01, 2020 <a href="https://OldSchoolFBCoach.github.io/blog/website-launch/">(Link)</a></div>
               <div><p>This is the new website for <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong>! <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong>
is an in-development American college football PC game in the sports management simulation
genre. You can call your team&rsquo;s plays and do your best to lead them to victory. For
a more in-depth experience, the game also offers a career mode where you can recruit new
players, set up depth charts, and other activities you would expect from a college football
coach.</p>
<p>I intend to add additional content to this site over time, such as pictures,
videos, and additional blog posts as development continue. Stay tuned!</p>
