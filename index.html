               <div><p>Happy Memorial Day! A new development build (21-06) of <strong>Old School Football Coach</strong> is now publicly available, which, in addition to various bug fixes, includes 2 major features!</p>
<h4 id="player-fatigue">Player Fatigue</h4>
<p>The football players on your team have always had a stamina attribute, but until now it didn&rsquo;t have a major impact on their performance. That all changes with this update. Players will now get fatigued as they play, and as their condition worsens so will their other abilities. You can combat this by temporarily benching your tired players and give them time to rest and recover.</p>

<h4 id="ui-scaling">UI Scaling</h4>
<p>Previously, playing the game on a small screen or high resolution display could make the UI elements small and hard to read. This build adds a UI scale adjustment to the Game Options. It is now possible to make the UI elements 1.5x or 2x bigger!  This may seem like a small change, but behind the scenes a lot of code needed to be written to make this possible. Though, do note that the game doesn&rsquo;t play well (and will warn you) when the UI is scaled with the window set at a low resolution. This effectively reduces the amount of space that UI elements have to fit inside of, which some screens and menus in the game can&rsquo;t yet accommodate.</p>
